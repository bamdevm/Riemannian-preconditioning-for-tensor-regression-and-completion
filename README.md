# Riemannian-preconditioning-for-tensor-regression-and-completion

There are two sets of codes: 1) "tensor completion" which include polished codes for tensor completion and 2) "tensor regression" which include polished codes for general tensor regression probelms inluding multilinear multitask learning problems.


The codes are based on the following works. 

H. Kasai, P. Jawanpuria, and B. Mishra, “A Riemannian approach to low-rank tensor learning”, Chapter in Tensors for Data Processing (978-0-12-824447-0), 2021.
